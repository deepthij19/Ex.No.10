# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date: 24.11.25
## Reg. No.212223060041

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

# Test Case Scenario 1: Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story
# FIRST DRAFT (Simple Prompt Output)
Prompt: “Write a short sci-fi story about space travel.”

# Output:
In the year 2450, humans traveled across galaxies. Captain Aira led a mission to explore a new planet, Veron. They discovered glowing plants and floating rocks. A signal from underground warned of a cosmic storm. Aira sent the warning to Earth and saved millions before escaping.

# REFINED CONTENT (Using Query Decomposition, Tone Filtering, Tail Generation)
Prompt Techniques Used:
• Break story into setting, characters, conflict, twist • Cinematic emotional tone • Extend story with a logical ending

# Refined Story:
By 2450, humanity had mastered interstellar travel, but the galaxy still held mysteries. Captain Aira Solen and her crew landed on Veron-6, a world filled with violet skies and bioluminescent forests. Deep underground, they found an alien memory core containing a warning: a dark-matter storm was spreading. Aira transmitted this data, enabling mass evacuations across seven planets. As Veron-6 collapsed into the storm, Aira realized that an extinct civilization had saved humanity one last time.

# MULTIPLE VERSIONS (Demonstrating Prompt Effects)
Decision-Making Version Ending chosen by AI based on prompt: hopeful or dark. • Hopeful: The storm is stopped by alien technology. • Dark: The storm continues and spreads.

Semantic Filter Version Tone changed to humorous and light-hearted.

Branching (Menu Action) Version Options: (A) Explore ruins (B) Decode alien core (C) Escape planet Each option produced a different storyline.

# FINAL POLISHED VERSION
Final Sci-Fi Story:
In 2450, Captain Aira Solen investigated Veron-6, a planet emitting mysterious quantum pulses. Beneath its glowing forests, she discovered an alien archive warning of a destructive dark-matter storm. Her transmission triggered a life-saving multi-planet evacuation. As Veron-6 vanished into the storm, Aira realized that even civilizations long gone can change the fate of the living.

# Test Case Scenario 2: Educational Report on Renewable Energy
# FIRST DRAFT (Simple Prompt Output)
Prompt: “Write a report on renewable energy.”

# Output:
Renewable energy comes from sunlight, wind, and water. It reduces pollution and is important for sustainability. Solar and wind are widely used. Renewable energy helps fight climate change.

# REFINED CONTENT (Using Answer Engineering, Fact-Check List, and Semantic Filtering)
# Refined Report:
Introduction Renewable energy comes from sources that naturally replenish, such as sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat. These sources are cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.

Types of Renewable Energy • Solar Power • Wind Power • Hydropower • Biomass • Geothermal Energy

Importance Renewable energy reduces emissions, supports energy security, and promotes sustainable economic growth.

Challenges • High installation cost • Weather-dependent power generation • Need for better storage systems

Future Trends Improvements in energy storage, hydrogen fuels, and smart grids will expand renewable energy adoption globally.

# MULTIPLE VERSIONS (Prompt-Based Variations)
Decision-Making Version Prompt: Focus on (A) Solar (B) Wind (C) Hydropower Output: Individual sub-reports based on chosen focus.

Simplified Tone Version Prompt: “Rewrite for high-school students.”

Structured Breakdown Version Prompt: “Divide the report into introduction, benefits, challenges, and future developments.”

# FINAL POLISHED VERSION
Final Educational Report: Renewable energy provides sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels by harnessing sunlight, wind, geothermal heat, and water flow. As the need for clean energy grows, renewable systems help reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, and support global energy independence. Despite challenges involving cost and intermittency, advancements in storage, green hydrogen, and grid modernization are accelerating adoption. In the future, renewable energy will play a major role in powering industries, homes, and transportation, contributing to a more resilient and environmentally responsible world.

# Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates that the quality, depth, and structure of AI-generated content heavily depend on how prompts are designed. By applying prompt patterns such as query decomposition, decision-making prompts, semantic filtering, and answer engineering, outputs can be significantly improved in coherence, creativity, factual accuracy, and engagement. This proves that well-structured prompting is essential for generating professional-quality reports, articles, and creative writing using AI tools.
